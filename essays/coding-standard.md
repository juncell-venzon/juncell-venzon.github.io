## Importance of Learning JavaScript and Coding Standards
In many software engineering courses, learning JavaScript is a common element of the curriculum. However, mastering the language is just one part of the equation. Maintaining proper coding standards and utilizing an efficient Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are equally crucial. 

## Why IntelliJ Stands Out Among IDEs
Among the variety of available IDEs, IntelliJ, developed by JetBrains, stands out as the go to choice for many JavaScript developers. Its popularity stems from its ability to streamline coding tasks, making the development process both easier and more efficient. With an array of features such as version control, plugins, database tools etc, IntelliJ offers a comprehensive suite for modern software development.

## Perspective on Coding Standard
Coding standards might initially seem somewhat useless. Many view them merely as style guides, focusing on the correct number of spaces between lines or the precise placement of curly braces/semicolons. However, after spending an entire week working with JavaScript and using tools like IntelliJ and ESLint, my perspective has changed. 

## Educational Aspect of ESLint
Other than being a software tool that promotes and forces strict coding style format, ESLint has a deeper meaning for its use. It serves as a really great framework that promotes good coding. The software educates you on how to write good code, not simply how to write code. When the coding format is broken just by a hair, The software quickly alerts you with red underlines underneath the area that is wrong and quickly conveys the reason behind the mistake. ESLint provides insights into the language itself. In this sense, meeting these requirements becomes a learning process to the user.

## A Week with IntelliJ and ESLint
During my first week using both IntelliJ and ESLint, I was a bit surprised. Although I had experience with similar IDE’s before, The abundance of  useful tools in IntelliJ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) exceeded my expectations. They were genuinely helpful and easier to use compared to the other IDE’s I've worked with in the past. The layout and functions felt straightforward and authentic, making the whole process enjoyable.

## Benefits of Using IntelliJ and ESLint
Using IntelliJ and ESLint together really helped me see the importance of coding standards. IntelliJ made my work easier by handling a lot of tasks smoothly, like finding errors and helping with version control. It's a really useful tool that does a lot. On the other hand, ESLint helped me write better code by consistently pointing out my mistakes whenever I decided to write bad code. This is really important when working with a team, because it makes sure everyone is writing code the same way. Thus making the code easier for everyone to read and work on.

## Insights Gained
Overall, coding standards go beyond than just being a simple set of style rules to follow. They evolve into a framework for high-quality coding, effective teamwork, and continuous learning. With the help of the right tools, these standards can even transform our code from just being functional to becoming a well crafted piece of art. As we keep up with the ever changing landscape of technology, it is important to remember the basic fundamentals that truly make us better at our crafts.
