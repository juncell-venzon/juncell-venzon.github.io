When getting ready for my first WOD, I went to all the practice sessions, whether they were in class or outside. I also made sure to redo each practice WOD a few times. Doing this helped me get better and made me feel more confident about finishing in time.

Even though I did pretty well in the graded WOD, I think there's more I can do. I found myself stopping a few times, trying to remember how to write certain code. For the next time, I plan to review my code more often so that I remember things faster and can keep my flow going.

The whole experience taught me a lot. I had to work under pressure while also  managing my time well. For the task, I used a simple if/else statement inside a for loop. I picked this because it was easy for me and quick to write. But after talking with others and thinking about it, I believe I could make a small change by moving the for loop outside the function. This might make the function more flexible for different tasks.

Lastly, talking about the WOD after finishing is really helpful. When we chat about how we did things, we can learn from each other and see different ways to solve the same problem. This kind of talk helps us learn and grow as coders.
