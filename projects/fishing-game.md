summary: "A fishing game me and my team developed for ICS211."
---



In this project, My group was tasked with developing a two player Fishing Tournament game, where participants take alternate turns on the same computer to catch fish and place them in their respective sacks (implemented using an ArrayList). The game stretches over 12 turns for each player (this is tracked by months January - December), and by the end, the player with the three largest fish emerges as the victor. The fish used in the game, derived from the FishableI_a subclass of the I_a superclass, possess unique characteristics such as legal size, open seasons, and methods of catching. Specific fish families, like Pua_ama mullet, Ohua/Uhu fish, and Oama/Weke fish, have distinct regulations that players must adhere to when fishing. The game comprises three main phases: setting up the Fish Pond with baby fish which grows over time, the primary fishing phase, and concluding with determining the winner based on the size of the caught fish.

In the Fishing Tournament Java project, I was entrusted with the task of creating a dedicated area for a particular fish family, as well as crafting the foundational driver and associated functions vital for game operation. Beyond my development duties, I also did quality check for our teams codebase. I reviewed and refined our collective work, ensuring it was not only clean and readable but also in strict compliance with the coding style regulations, guaranteeing consistency and excellence throughout our project.
